                    <p>At the end of second year me and a team of three others were tasked to create a 2.5D game for the <em>PlayStation 5</em> using the PS5 Devkits at Abertay. We used the university's own <em>inhouse engine</em> which was an educational experience, working with a changing engine which isn't mainstream. This project was fully programmed in C++ using an <em>Entity Component System</em> for object management, <em>ImGui</em> for the in-game GUI and <em>Box2D</em> for in-game physics. I worked alongside 3 other developers using <em>Git source control</em> as well as a <em>development plan</em>. </p>

                    <p>I was tasked with git branch management and workload distribution as well as my typical development tasks. I took responsibility for some of the underlying systems of the game such as setting up the <em>physics components and systems</em> as well as a <em>custom scene manager</em>. I also worked on core game systems like the <em>in game trick system</em> which took inspiration from Skate 3. I have learned many valuable things from this project such as using and creating <em>Singletons, abstract classes</em>, working with a custom ECS and aspects of data oriented design. I've also developed my Git knowledge which I look forward to using on future team projects. </p>
