                    <p>Blotter is an <em>online multiplayer</em> bingo game for 2-4 players. I wanted to take on a small challenge over the summer by creating a simple online multiplayer game. This solo project had me working on all corners of game development, most of the assets for the game were produced by myself. The game was created in the <em>Godot engine</em> using their multiplayer API, adapted from the <em>ENet library</em>. This is my first complete project in Godot and I have been able to transfer my knowledge from work with other engines and use it to accelerate the process of learning how to use Godot. I have learned a lot about networking and online play from creating Blotter, having used systems like <em>Peers and RPCs</em>. Additionally I have advanced my <em>documentation reading skills</em> as, at the time of creating, there was not a lot of online information regarding Godotâ€™s multiplayer. </p>

                    <p>I have learned a lot from this project and there are definitely things I would like to improve upon or do differently. The music could do with some improvements, I created it myself with hardly any musical experience. I would have liked to organise the bingo manager slightly better, perhaps separating the Game State switch case into separate functions or scripts altogether. Additionally he bingo card generation algorithm could be made more efficient, but I have made it so it should be easy to swap out with another (more efficient) algorithm. </p>
