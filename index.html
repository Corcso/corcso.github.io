                        <p>Still forgotten is a non-Euclidean narrative stealth game where you are on a mission to discover your past, inspired by works from David Lynch. This game was developed for my professional project, working in a multidisciplinary team of 8. Alongside development we had regular deliverables, client meetings & feedback sessions, required documentation and a press kit to produce. I worked on various systems for this project, the most notable of which are listed above. </p>

                        <p>Squirrel Engine is a C++ 3D game engine. It is currently a work in progress <strong>solo project</strong> which so far uses scene graph representation with a node like object structure to create games. Similar to that of Godot. It makes use of Direct X 11 for rendering which is abstracted away for platform independence. Currently the engine supports scene serialization, physics, threaded loading, custom memory management for performance, and basic lighting. </p>

We used the university's own inhouse engine which was an educational experience, working with a changing engine which isn't mainstream. This project was fully programmed in C++ using an Entity Component System for object management, ImGui for the in-game GUI and Box2D for in-game physics.

This <strong>solo project</strong> had me working on all corners of game development, most of the assets for the game were produced by myself. The game was created in the Godot engine using their multiplayer API, adapted from the ENet library. This is my first complete project in Godot and I have been able to transfer my knowledge from work with other engines and use it to accelerate the process of learning how to use Godot...</p>

                            <p>For my CPU second year multithreading project I chose to develop a relational database system which makes use of multithreading for large commands. The database can store 3 types of data and can read and write the database to a file. Multithreading is then used for sorting, searching and performing an inner join on tables.</p>

                            <p>For my GPU second year multithreading project I chose to develop a Mandelbrot set viewer. With the program you can zoom into parts of the Mandelbrot set and tweak parameters. The parts in and out of the set are calculated on the GPU using the SYCL framework and rendered using SFML.</p>

                            <p>Debugger is a top down 2D endless shooter which has you shooting a variety of bugs which are coming your way.  We used unity to develop this project and Git for the source control. I worked on the enemy spawning, title screen and parts of the player control. I learned more about unity development from this project as well as source control management and git branching and merging. <a style="border-bottom: #D0CCD0 2px solid;" href="./portfolio/debugger/">Read More</a></p>

                                After meeting Geoff on a search for work experience in high school he offered me some a part time position to gain experience as an <em>assistant web developer</em>. After a few months of learning and showcasing my skills I was taken on officially working for Todd Workshop. After a year of working at Todd Workshop and growing my skillset I was asked to join his new startup <a href="https://ventsys.io">Ventsys</a>, a report creation application for the ventilation cleaning industry. Working there I developed <em>team working skills</em> and was able to apply my technical knowledge in a professional setting. Eventually <a href="https://teamfarsight.com">Farsight Digital Solutions</a> acquired both Ventsys and Todd Workshop and I was taken on as a <em>Platform Architect</em>. I've been with Farsight since it was founded in July of 2023 and it has taught me so much. During my time I have worked on various business systems, from inventory management to job tracking software.
